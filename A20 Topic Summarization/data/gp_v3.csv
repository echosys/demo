The mean residuals are convertible to other operating speed ranges of the engine and can be subtracted from the engine speed measurements to remove the static errors.

WO-2012059082-A3,20111101,"Highly flexible endoscope made of silicone, and method for producing same","The invention relates to a flexible endoscope or an endoscope attachment and to a method for producing same. Until now only glass fiber endoscopes have existed for examining very small channels that are highly sensitive to mechanical or sensory stimuli in particular in medicine, such as the tuba auditiva for example. Said glass fiber endoscopes are flexible but still too rigid to be painlessly inserted into the middle ear for example. Thus, said glass fiber endoscopes carry the risk of hemorrhages and mucous membrane injuries which can lead  inter alia  to the formation of scars with subsequent chronic middle ear inflammation. A soft, highly flexible endoscope made of silicone would solve said problems and render operations such as those that are currently carried out for diagnostic purposes unnecessary in many cases. The flexibility of the endoscope is achieved by using silicone as the imaging material. The light guides are produced from highly flexible soft silicone that is highly transparent in the light spectrum required for use by applying, pressing, and curing silicones that are initially liquid in layers. Each layer, which has a thickness of only a few micrometers, consists of rib waveguides which have a width and height of a few micrometers and which are made of a highly refractive silicone layer (core) surrounded by a weakly refractive silicone layer (casing), and each strip waveguide of the highly refractive structured layer generates an image pixel. A soft silicone lens (2) which can be produced by curing a drop of silicone on an anti-adhesive coated substrate focuses the image signal onto the waveguide matrix (1). The waveguide matrix (1) and the lens (2) are encased with an optically highly transparent, weakly refractive casing (3). An optically insulating soft material (4), for example silicone, is subsequently applied by spraying, brushing, or the like and cured. Further functions can be realized in said optically insulating layer (4), for example a mechanical control that is realized by thin metal bands, by means of which the distal end of the endoscope can be bent, or channels for feeding and suctioning liquids. Finally, the endoscope is coated with an optically conductive casing which is used to supply light for lighting the object to be observed and which consists of an optically transparent silicone layer or a layer system of optically transparent, weakly and highly refractive silicone layers, wherein a highly refractive shaft 6 can be found between two weakly refractive shafts (5) and (7) so that the light is guided in the highly refractive region (6). The silicone endoscope is suitable for examining very small channels that are highly sensitive to mechanical or sensory stimuli in particular in medicine on the basis of the material properties of the silicone endoscope."

WO-2017119805-A2,20161206,"Ultralight, economical and easy-to-handle electric vehicle","The invention relates to an electric-propulsion locomotion and transport vehicle that is hybrid under certain conditions, characterised in that it has a cylindrical passenger compartment 1 received in and positioned on two drive wheels (Fig. A). The wheels 1 and 2 have an inside diameter sufficiently larger than that of the passenger compartment 1 for a series of dampers 7 to be inserted between the passenger compartment and the wheels. Main support rings 5 and 6 form the interface between the stationary passenger compartment and the rotating wheels. A mechanism consisting of an auxiliary wheel 34 mounted under a frame rigidly connected with the passenger compartment 1 prevents the latter from overturning in case of abrupt braking. Since each wheel 1 and 2 is driven by its own electric motor 16 or 17, this technique makes the vehicle extremely easy to handle, to such an extent that it is capable of parking or making a reverse turn in less than five seconds on a roadway that does not exceed one and a half times its width. This new concept-car can also partially charge its batteries simply by changing direction, which is now achieved without a steering wheel just by pressing buttons, through the recovery of a portion of its kinetic energy. The vehicle is characterised by a low power consumption as compared to the current state of the art, mainly because of the lightness of the vehicle and also because of the simplicity of transmitting mechanical power to the wheels. The vehicle is characterised by its cylindrical architecture that obviates the use of many components. Together, all these concepts are advantageous in providing the vehicle with an autonomy which far exceeds that of current cars. The vehicle is characterised by its design, in particular its smooth and planar, optionally corrugated, outer shape, whereby it can be uniformly covered with a large surface area of photovoltaic cells.
